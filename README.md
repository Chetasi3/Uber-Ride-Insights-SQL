# Uber Ride Insights
## Overview
In this Project, we worked on a simulated dataset inspired by the operations of a ride-hailing service like Uber. The dataset consists of information related to rides, drivers, and passengers. Our goal is to analyze and gain insights from this data using SQL queries and techniques.

In our analysis of Uber's Rides insight, we delve into a dataset encompassing three core tables: **'Rides'**,**'Drivers'**, and **'Passengers'**. 
* The **'Rides'** table encompasses detailed ride-related information such as ride specifics, driver and passenger identifiers,pickup and dropoff locations, ride distance, duration, fare amount, and payment methods. 
* The **'Drivers'** table encapsulates essential driver attributes including driver ID, name, join date, rating, ride count, and earnings. 
* Lastly, the **'Passengers'** table encompasses passenger attributes, such as passenger ID, name, signup date, total rides taken, total spending, and passenger ratings.

## Key Insights
* Analyze driver performance based on ride count, average ratings, and earnings. Identify top-performing drivers who complete the most rides and maintain high ratings.
* Examine passenger habits, including the number of rides taken and total spending. Identify high-value passengers who contribute significantly to platform revenue.
* Calculate the total revenue generated from all completed rides. Break down the revenue based on specific periods or categories (e.g., by day, week, or driver).
* Analyze driver and passenger ratings to evaluate service quality. Identify potential areas of improvement for drivers who consistently receive low ratings.

## Technologies Used
**SQL**: Queries for data extraction, aggregation, and analysis.

**DBViewer**: This is used for creating the database and running queries.
