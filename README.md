In this Project, we worked on a simulated dataset inspired by the operations of a ride-hailing service like Uber. The dataset consists of information related to rides, drivers, and passengers. Our goal is to analyze and gain insights from this data using SQL queries and techniques.

In our analysis of Uber's Ride-Hailing Operations, we delve into a dataset encompassing three core tables: 'Rides,' 'Drivers,' and 'Passengers'. 
  The 'Rides' table encompasses detailed ride-related information such as ride specifics, driver and passenger identifiers,pickup and dropoff locations, ride distance, duration, fare amount, and payment methods. 
  The 'Drivers' table encapsulates essential driver attributes including driver ID, name, join date, rating, ride count, and earnings. 
  Lastly, the 'Passengers' table encompasses passenger attributes, such as passenger ID, name, signup date, total rides taken, total spending, and passenger ratings.
